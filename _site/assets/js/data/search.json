    "content": "How Bitcoin Stays Decentralized: Proof-of-Work (PoW)In blockchain, mining refers to establishing a block’s ownership by a consensus algorithm. There are several consensus algorithms, but Bitcoin uses Proof-of-Work (PoW). PoW is an algorithm that rewards ownership of a block by showing that you’ve put in the “computational effort” to find a particular result. At this time, anyone can receive a reward as long as they make a “computational effort” and find the answer first, and since all participants in the network verify the validity of the solution together, the blockchain can maintain decentralization.Bitcoin’s PoW allows mining to occur approximately every 10 minutes by adjusting the difficulty of mining accordingly. The difficulty is adjusted by checking the average mining time interval between blocks every 2016 blocks and increasing the difficulty if the interval is narrower than 10 minutes and decreasing the difficulty if it is wider.Mining difficulty is related to “hashrate”. Hashrate is a measure of a miner’s computational power required for mining. In general, as the computational power of a miner increases, the time it takes to mine decreases and the difficulty increases, which can be understood as “increased hashrate≈ increased mining difficulty”.Bitcoin’s hashrate from 2016 until now. (Source: Coin Metrics, 2021)The graph above shows the hashrate of Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s Hashrate has been steadily moving upwards in the past. This means that the computer power required to successfully mine is getting higher and higher, making it harder and harder for individuals to mine.The Rise of Mining Pools and How They Undermine DecentralizationThe reason why mining becomes difficult for individuals is due to computational processing power limitations, so groups of people have emerged to compute together. These are called mining pools. A mining pool connects multiple miners to perform computations like a supercomputer and distributes mining rewards based on the ratio of each miner’s hash power. In this case, hash power refers to the computational processing power of each miner.Distribution of the Bitcoin network’s hashrate (Source: Blockchain.com, 2019)However, mining pools have recently grown in size, threatening the decentralization of Bitcoin. The chart above shows the hashrate share of mining pools on the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin is able to keep malicious participants in check during the consensus process as long as they do not exceed 51% of the total. However, the combined hashpower of two or three current mining pools is close to 51%, making it possible for transactions to be manipulated. This expansion of mining pools undermines the decentralization of Bitcoin’s underlying philosophy and needs to be addressed.PoA (Proof-of-Age): A Consensus Algorithm that Leads to Solo MiningMining pools are not good for Bitcoin’s decentralization, so we need to encourage solo mining.Pooling is not Favorable: Decentralize Mining Power of PoW Blockchain Using Age-of-WorkThe paper “Pooling is not Favorable: Decentralize Mining Power of PoW Blockchain Using Age-of-Work (by Long Shi, Taotao Wang, Jun Li, and Shengli Zhang)”, pictured above, proposes a Proof-of-Age (PoA) consensus algorithm that induces solo mining.PoA is built on the framework of PoW (Proof-of-Work) and inherits the basic properties of PoW. However, unlike PoW, which rewards only the first-place winner, PoA rewards according to the “Effective Mining Period,” which is the period during which the participant actively attempts to mine, even if the mining is not successful. (The exact meaning of “actively trying to mine” will be explained later (in “D. Mining Results.”)) Since mining competition is necessary to maintain the Bitcoin network, PoA rewards not only first place, but also competitors who contribute to the maintenance of the blockchain, and adjusts the degree of reward for each miner, creating an incentive for independent mining.We’ll explain the design of PoA in five parts. This section assumes a basic understanding of the Bitcoin block structure and block generation process.  Hash Puzzle  Age Ring  Age-of-Work (AoW)  Mining Outcomes  Difficulty AdjustmentA. Hash PuzzleA hash puzzle is a problem that needs to be solved using computational power in PoW. First, let’s look at a hash puzzle in PoW.Hash Puzzle of PoWk is the height of the candidate block (how many blocks up the chain it is). H() is a cryptographic hash function. Let h_{k} be a sequence of bits resulting from H(), of length L. As input to H(), b_{k-1} is the hash of the previous block header, x_{k} is the nonce (answer value), and y_{k} is the hash of other data in the candidate block (such as the Merkle root of a transaction). D is the difficulty of the hash puzzle and T(D) is the target value. Since difficulty means that the D most significant bits of the hash value must be zero as a condition for a correct answer, T(D) is expressed as 2^{L-D}.Therefore, as shown in the equation above, the probability of finding a block hash less than or equal to T(D) decreases as the difficulty D increases. Conversely, as D decreases, the probability increases.If we extend this hash puzzle to PoA, it looks like thisHash Puzzle of PoAUnlike PoW, r_{k} and PK_{i} are added. r_{k} is the “age ring” of a miner in a block of height k, and PK_{i} is the public key of miner i.B. Age RingSo what is an age ring?Miner i wants to mine a block of height k. At this point, miner i has a history of successfully mining a block at k-n. In this case, miner i’s age ring in block l is equal to the above expression. w_{l} is the argument that proves the validity of r_{l}, and the method of generating w_{l} will be explained in “D. Mining output”. First, note that w_{l} in a block is initialized to NULL (nonzero since it’s a bitstream operation) immediately after successful mining. b_{l-1} is the hash of the l-1st block header. &lt;.&gt; is a concatenating operation that concatenates the arguments in order.In simple terms, r_{l} is the value derived from the hash value of the previous block (b_{l-1}) and the age ring of the previous block (r_{l-1}). This means that there is another chain that is independent of the main blockchain, but related to it. As illustrated below:In the picture, the square chains represent blockchains and the circled chains represent age rings. I thought about what the original Ring could be a metaphor for and realized that it was meant to represent a key ring on a key. The age rings we’re going to talk about are like key chains attached to the main chain. Because age rings are present in every block and dependent on each other, they exist in the form of a chain, and “each miner” has one of those chains. (This is a completely different concept from sidechains).C. Age-of-Work (AoW)So, let’s use an “age chain” to represent how long a participant has been actively mining, or in other words, their “age”.Δ_{i}(l) is the Age-of-Work (AoW) that miner i has on a block of height l. We can interpret AoW as “age”. As shown in the expression above, miner i ages one year every time they “actively” participate in mining. And when they successfully mine, their age is reset to 0.D. Mining OutcomesSo how do we know that someone has actively attempted to mine, and how do we validate the age rings? This paper addresses both of these needs in a very innovative way.An illustration of three different mining outcomes.First of all, to judge the user’s activeness, we use the region of the result of the Hash Puzzle of PoA expression in “A. Hash Puzzle” as a reference. T_{M} is the target value of block mining, T_{A} is the target value of the age ring, and 2^L is the region of all possible results. Then T_{M} &lt; T_{A} ≤ 2^L. Here, T_{A} is a fixed value and can be reached with little computational effort. Unlike T_{A, the difficulty of T_{M} is scaled by the AoW. (Recall the hash puzzle expression where T_{M} has a difficulty D as an argument).[ Result I ]If the result is in the range 0 to T_{M}, you have found the correct answer for block mining.In this case, the age ring’s w_{k} is reset to NULL, the AoW is initialized to 0, and the miner gets the main chain’s mining reward.[ Result II ]If the result falls between T_{M} and T_{A}, it means that you haven’t found the correct answer to mining the block, but you have tried to mine aggressively enough.The value of x_{k} at this time becomes the value of w_{k} in the age chain, which is not the actual blockchain nonce value, but the value of x_{k} that shows activeness becomes w_{k}. This is how the correct answer to the age ring chain is found and the age ring is validated.[ Result III ]If the result is greater than T_{A}, then we have found neither the correct answer for block mining nor the correct answer for age ring mining.So no change in value occurs.E. Difficulty AdjustmentThe difficulty is provided as a factor in T_{M} in “D. Mining output”. And this difficulty D is determined by the AoW. In this paper, we assign difficulty based on whether the AoW exceeds a threshold. For example, if the threshold is δ and we divide it into two regions, we have the following equation.If the AoW is less than or equal to δ, the difficulty is high; if it is greater than or equal to δ, the difficulty is low. In other words, miners who actively participate in mining but are not successful are rewarded with a lower difficulty.Putting it all together.Let’s look again at the PoA hash puzzle expression we saw above.Hash Puzzle of PoATo mine the main blockchain, we need to know r_{k} in addition to x_{k}, which we had to find in the previous PoW. However, this r_{k} is the value generated by the w_{k} being mined. The AoW is then updated based on whether this r_{k} falls within T_{M}, T_{A}, or 2^L of the target value range. Finally, a miner who has been actively trying to mine, but has never succeeded, and has only been increasing the AoW value, will be rewarded with a lower difficulty (D2) when mining blocks, increasing the probability of successful mining.The paper suggests the following five effects that can be derived from the proof-of-age we’ve seen so far. I suggest you extrapolate from the above.      Remark 1: Age-ring chains — Age-ring chains rely on the previous age-ring value and the hash value of the previous block. This has the advantage that it is pointless to precompute the age-ring chain separately, or to break up the chain to create confusion.    Remark 2: Negligible overhead of age ring — The age ring is included as one argument when generating the block hash value, so its overhead is negligible.    Remark 3: Block verification — When a block is deployed, it includes a nonce value and an age ring, making it easy to verify that both values are appropriate.    Remark 4: Sybil attack resistance — Miner i is identified by its public key PK_{i}. Even if we assume that a number of new participants come in for a Sybil attack, the AoW of all of them is initially set to 0, so they have to break through the high mining difficulty. Therefore, PoA can resist Sybil attacks.    Remark 5: Memoryless mining — Memory is not used, so if you succeed in mining a valid age ring, you can put the age ring as an argument to the PoA hash puzzle and continue to mine blocks. This has the advantage of not using memory, so the probability of mining does not change.  "

    "content": "PrerequisitesFollow the instructions in the Jekyll Docs to complete the installation of the basic environment. Git also needs to be installed.InstallationCreating a New SiteThere are two ways to create a new repository for this theme:  Using the Chirpy Starter — Easy to upgrade, isolates irrelevant project files so you can focus on writing.  GitHub Fork — Convenient for custom development, but difficult to upgrade. Unless you are familiar with Jekyll and are determined to tweak or contribute to this project, this approach is not recommended.Option 1. Using the Chirpy StarterSign in to GitHub and browse to Chirpy Starter, click the button Use this template &gt; Create a new repository, and name the new repository USERNAME.github.io, where USERNAME represents your GitHub username.Option 2. GitHub ForkSign in to GitHub to fork Chirpy, and then rename it to USERNAME.github.io (USERNAME means your username).Next, clone the repository to your local machine, make sure it has Node.js installed, then go to the root directory of the repo and run the following command:$ bash tools/init.sh  If you don’t want to deploy your site on GitHub Pages, append option --no-gh at the end of the above command.The above command will:  Check out the code to the latest tag (to ensure the stability of your site: as the code for the default branch is under development).  Remove non-essential sample files and take care of GitHub-related files.  Build CSS/JS assets files and then make them tracked by Git.  Automatically create a new commit to save the changes above.Installing DependenciesBefore running local server for the first time, go to the root directory of your site and run:$ bundleUsageConfigurationUpdate the variables in _config.yml as needed. Some typical options include:  url  avatar  timezone  langSocial Contact OptionsSocial contact options are displayed at the bottom of the sidebar. You can enable or disable specific contacts in the _data/contact.yml file.Customizing the StylesheetTo customize the stylesheet, copy the theme’s assets/css/jekyll-theme-chirpy.scss file to the same path in your Jekyll site, and add your custom styles at the end of the file.Starting with version 6.2.0, if you want to overwrite the SASS variables defined in _sass/addon/variables.scss, copy the main SASS file _sass/main.scss to the _sass directory in your site’s source, then create a new file _sass/variables-hook.scss and assign your new values there.Customizing Static AssetsStatic assets configuration was introduced in version 5.1.0. The CDN of the static assets is defined in _data/origin/cors.yml. You can replace some of them based on to the network conditions in the region where your website is published.Also, if you’d like to self-host the static assets, please refer to the chirpy-static-assets.Running Local ServerYou may want to preview the site contents before publishing, so just run it by:$ bundle exec jekyll sAfter a few seconds, the local service will be published at http://127.0.0.1:4000.DeploymentBefore deploying, check the _config.yml file and ensure the url is configured correctly. If you prefer a project site and don’t use a custom domain, or if you want to visit your website with a base URL on a web server other than GitHub Pages, remember to set the baseurl to your project name, starting with a slash, e.g., /project-name.Now you can choose ONE of the following methods to deploy your Jekyll site.Deploy Using GitHub ActionsPrepare the following:  If you’re on the GitHub Free plan, keep your site repository public.      If you have committed Gemfile.lock to the repository, and your local machine is not running Linux, update the platform list of the lock file:    $ bundle lock --add-platform x86_64-linux      Next, configure the Pages service:      Go to your repository on GitHub. Select the Settings tab, then click Pages in the left navigation bar. In the Source section (under Build and deployment), select GitHub Actions from the dropdown menu.        Push any commits to GitHub to trigger the Actions workflow. In the Actions tab of your repository, you should see the workflow Build and Deploy running. Once the build is complete and successful, the site will be deployed automatically.  You can now visit the URL provided by GitHub to access your site.Manual Build and DeploymentFor self-hosted servers, you will need to build the site on your local machine and then upload the site files to the server.Navigate to the root of the source project, and build your site with the following command:$ JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll bUnless you specified the output path, the generated site files will be placed in the _site folder of the project’s root directory. Upload these files to your target server."

    "content": "This tutorial will guide you how to write a post in the Chirpy template, and it’s worth reading even if you’ve used Jekyll before, as many features require specific variables to be set.Naming and PathCreate a new file named YYYY-MM-DD-TITLE.EXTENSION and put it in the _posts of the root directory. Please note that the EXTENSION must be one of md and markdown. If you want to save time of creating files, please consider using the plugin Jekyll-Compose to accomplish this.Front MatterBasically, you need to fill the Front Matter as below at the top of the post:---title: TITLEdate: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +/-TTTTcategories: [TOP_CATEGORIE, SUB_CATEGORIE]tags: [TAG]     # TAG names should always be lowercase---  The posts’ layout has been set to post by default, so there is no need to add the variable layout in the Front Matter block.Timezone of DateTo accurately record the release date of a post, you should not only set up the timezone of _config.yml but also provide the post’s timezone in variable date of its Front Matter block. Format: +/-TTTT, e.g. +0800.Categories and TagsThe categories of each post are designed to contain up to two elements, and the number of elements in tags can be zero to infinity. For instance:---categories: [Animal, Insect]tags: [bee]---Author InformationThe author information of the post usually does not need to be filled in the Front Matter , they will be obtained from variables social.name and the first entry of social.links of the configuration file by default. But you can also override it as follows:Adding author information in _data/authors.yml (If your website doesn’t have this file, don’t hesitate to create one).&lt;author_id&gt;:  name: &lt;full name&gt;  twitter: &lt;twitter_of_author&gt;  url: &lt;homepage_of_author&gt;And then use author to specify a single entry or authors to specify multiple entries:---author: &lt;author_id&gt;                     # for single entry# orauthors: [&lt;author1_id&gt;, &lt;author2_id&gt;]   # for multiple entries---Having said that, the key author can also identify multiple entries.  The benefit of reading the author information from the file _data/authors.yml is that the page will have the meta tag twitter:creator, which enriches the Twitter Cards and is good for SEO.Post DescriptionBy default, the first words of the post are used to display on the home page for a list of posts, in the Further Reading section, and in the XML of the RSS feed. If you don’t want to display the auto-generated description for the post, you can customize it using the description field in the Front Matter as follows:---description: Short summary of the post.---Additionally, the description text will also be displayed under the post title on the post’s page.Table of ContentsBy default, the Table of Contents (TOC) is displayed on the right panel of the post. If you want to turn it off globally, go to _config.yml and set the value of variable toc to false. If you want to turn off TOC for a specific post, add the following to the post’s Front Matter:---toc: false---CommentsThe global switch of comments is defined by variable comments.active in the file _config.yml. After selecting a comment system for this variable, comments will be turned on for all posts.If you want to close the comment for a specific post, add the following to the Front Matter of the post:---comments: false---MediaWe refer to images, audio and video as media resources in Chirpy.URL PrefixFrom time to time we have to define duplicate URL prefixes for multiple resources in a post, which is a boring task that you can avoid by setting two parameters.      If you are using a CDN to host media files, you can specify the cdn in _config.yml. The URLs of media resources for site avatar and posts are then prefixed with the CDN domain name.    cdn: https://cdn.com            To specify the resource path prefix for the current post/page range, set media_subpath in the front matter of the post:    ---media_subpath: /path/to/media/---      The option site.cdn and page.media_subpath can be used individually or in combination to flexibly compose the final resource URL: [site.cdn/][page.media_subpath/]file.extImagesCaptionAdd italics to the next line of an image, then it will become the caption and appear at the bottom of the image:![img-description](/path/to/image)_Image Caption_SizeTo prevent the page content layout from shifting when the image is loaded, we should set the width and height for each image.![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: width=\"700\" height=\"400\" }  For an SVG, you have to at least specify its width, otherwise it won’t be rendered.Starting from Chirpy v5.0.0, height and width support abbreviations (height → h, width → w). The following example has the same effect as the above:![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: w=\"700\" h=\"400\" }PositionBy default, the image is centered, but you can specify the position by using one of the classes normal, left, and right.  Once the position is specified, the image caption should not be added.      Normal position    Image will be left aligned in below sample:    ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .normal }            Float to the left    ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .left }            Float to the right    ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .right }      Dark/Light modeYou can make images follow theme preferences in dark/light mode. This requires you to prepare two images, one for dark mode and one for light mode, and then assign them a specific class (dark or light):![Light mode only](/path/to/light-mode.png){: .light }![Dark mode only](/path/to/dark-mode.png){: .dark }ShadowThe screenshots of the program window can be considered to show the shadow effect:![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .shadow }Preview ImageIf you want to add an image at the top of the post, please provide an image with a resolution of 1200 x 630. Please note that if the image aspect ratio does not meet 1.91 : 1, the image will be scaled and cropped.Knowing these prerequisites, you can start setting the image’s attribute:---image:  path: /path/to/image  alt: image alternative text---Note that the media_subpath can also be passed to the preview image, that is, when it has been set, the attribute path only needs the image file name.For simple use, you can also just use image to define the path.---image: /path/to/image---LQIPFor preview images:---image:  lqip: /path/to/lqip-file # or base64 URI---  You can observe LQIP in the preview image of post \"Text and Typography\".For normal images:![Image description](/path/to/image){: lqip=\"/path/to/lqip-file\" }VideoSocial Media PlatformYou can embed videos from social media platforms with the following syntax:{% include embed/{Platform}.html id='{ID}' %}Where Platform is the lowercase of the platform name, and ID is the video ID.The following table shows how to get the two parameters we need in a given video URL, and you can also know the currently supported video platforms.            Video URL      Platform      ID                  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-B46URT4mg      youtube      H-B46URT4mg              https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1634779211      twitch      1634779211              https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Q44y1B7Wf      bilibili      BV1Q44y1B7Wf      Video FilesIf you want to embed a video file directly, use the following syntax:{% include embed/video.html src='{URL}' %}Where URL is a URL to a video file e.g. /path/to/sample/video.mp4.You can also specify additional attributes for the embedded video file. Here is a full list of attributes allowed.  poster='/path/to/poster.png' — poster image for a video that is shown while video is downloading  title='Text' — title for a video that appears below the video and looks same as for images  autoplay=true — video automatically begins to play back as soon as it can  loop=true — automatically seek back to the start upon reaching the end of the video  muted=true — audio will be initially silenced  types — specify the extensions of additional video formats separated by |. Ensure these files exist in the same directory as your primary video file.Consider an example using all of the above:{%  include embed/video.html  src='/path/to/video.mp4'  types='ogg|mov'  poster='poster.png'  title='Demo video'  autoplay=true  loop=true  muted=true%}AudiosIf you want to embed an audio file directly, use the following syntax:{% include embed/audio.html src='{URL}' %}Where URL is a URL to an audio file e.g. /path/to/audio.mp3.You can also specify additional attributes for the embedded audio file. Here is a full list of attributes allowed.  title='Text' — title for an audio that appears below the audio and looks same as for images  types — specify the extensions of additional audio formats separated by |. Ensure these files exist in the same directory as your primary audio file.Consider an example using all of the above:{%  include embed/audio.html  src='/path/to/audio.mp3'  types='ogg|wav|aac'  title='Demo audio'%}Pinned PostsYou can pin one or more posts to the top of the home page, and the fixed posts are sorted in reverse order according to their release date. Enable by:---pin: true---PromptsThere are several types of prompts: tip, info, warning, and danger. They can be generated by adding the class prompt-{type} to the blockquote. For example, define a prompt of type info as follows:&gt; Example line for prompt.{: .prompt-info }SyntaxInline Code`inline code part`Filepath Highlight`/path/to/a/file.extend`{: .filepath}Code BlockMarkdown symbols ``` can easily create a code block as follows:```This is a plaintext code snippet.```Specifying LanguageUsing ```{language} you will get a code block with syntax highlight:```yamlkey: value```  The Jekyll tag {% highlight %} is not compatible with this theme.Line NumberBy default, all languages except plaintext, console, and terminal will display line numbers. When you want to hide the line number of a code block, add the class nolineno to it:```shellecho 'No more line numbers!'```{: .nolineno }Specifying the FilenameYou may have noticed that the code language will be displayed at the top of the code block. If you want to replace it with the file name, you can add the attribute file to achieve this:```shell# content```{: file=\"path/to/file\" }Liquid CodesIf you want to display the Liquid snippet, surround the liquid code with {% raw %} and {% endraw %}:{% raw %}```liquid{% if product.title contains 'Pack' %}  This product's title contains the word Pack.{% endif %}```{% endraw %}Or adding render_with_liquid: false (Requires Jekyll 4.0 or higher) to the post’s YAML block.MathematicsWe use MathJax to generate mathematics. For website performance reasons, the mathematical feature won’t be loaded by default. But it can be enabled by:---math: true---After enabling the mathematical feature, you can add math equations with the following syntax:  Block math should be added with $$ math $$ with mandatory blank lines before and after $$          Inserting equation numbering should be added with $$\\begin{equation} math \\end{equation}$$      Referencing equation numbering should be done with \\label{eq:label_name} in the equation block and \\eqref{eq:label_name} inline with text (see example below)        Inline math (in lines) should be added with $$ math $$ without any blank line before or after $$  Inline math (in lists) should be added with \\$$ math $$&lt;!-- Block math, keep all blank lines --&gt;$$LaTeX_math_expression$$&lt;!-- Equation numbering, keep all blank lines  --&gt;$$\\begin{equation}  LaTeX_math_expression  \\label{eq:label_name}\\end{equation}$$Can be referenced as \\eqref{eq:label_name}.&lt;!-- Inline math in lines, NO blank lines --&gt;\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, $$ LaTeX_math_expression $$ consectetur adipiscing elit.\"&lt;!-- Inline math in lists, escape the first `$` --&gt;1. \\$$ LaTeX_math_expression $$2. \\$$ LaTeX_math_expression $$3. \\$$ LaTeX_math_expression $$  Starting with v7.0.0, configuration options for MathJax have been moved to file assets/js/data/mathjax.js, and you can change the options as needed, such as adding extensions.If you are building the site via chirpy-starter, copy that file from the gem installation directory (check with command bundle info --path jekyll-theme-chirpy) to the same directory in your repository.MermaidMermaid is a great diagram generation tool.
